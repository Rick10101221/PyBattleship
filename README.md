# Battleship but for Python
So this is a project my friend and I decided to tackle after our outstanding success with our python calculator. 
We have plans on making multiple versions with the same core skeleton of our original version, which is why we spent
most of our development time and planning in 1coord. We want to make it 2 players! Just another way for friendships
to be destroyed.

# Why Battleship?
Well we wanted to start off simple. After our calculator application, it was only fitting to create a simple game.
Also, I thought it would be a great opportunity to introduce my friend to the world of coding. He's an aerospace
and mechanical engineering double major at UCD who knows MATLAB. He thought it would be cool to work on a project
together, so here we are. 

# Where We're Going from Here
Hopefully, we plan to make something like this:<br>

A little ambituous, I know, but we'll get there. Starting off simple and getting the basics down is the most important
thing we can do for ourselves now. It's only up from here.
